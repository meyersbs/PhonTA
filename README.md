# PhonTA

## Phonetic Transcription Assistant

## Project Description
PhonTA is a command line tool for translating words and groups of words into their [Iternational Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) transcriptions, and (<i>hopefully</i>) vice versa.

This is NOT meant to translate from one language to another; I will not be including the functionality to translate between English and Spanish, for example. Translations will be from the base language (English, Spanish, etc.) to either IPA or Arpabet, and vice versa.
